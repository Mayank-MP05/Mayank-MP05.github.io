# Car-Quality-Full-Stack-ML-Project

This is Full Stack Machine Learning Project.Its started from scratch with the car dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation

As per Site Data Info() is as follows
Attribute Information:

#### Class Values:

unacc, acc, good, vgood

#### Attributes:

buying: vhigh, high, med, low.

maint: vhigh, high, med, low.

doors: 2, 3, 4, 5more.

persons: 2, 4, more.

lug_boot: small, med, big.

safety: low, med, high.

#### Workflow of the Project
1. Getting data file without header
2. Adding header and cleaning NULL/NaN valuses
3. Analysis of Data to check Dependancies
4. After enough Visuals clealy stating of data dependancies
5. Bulding Logistic Regression Model
6. Trying out diff sklearn models for accuracy
7. After Max accuracy saving model with pickle
8. Web app developement
9. Load the model
10. Get Data from front-end and cast to dataframe
11. Predict the Data
12. Show user the Outputs
