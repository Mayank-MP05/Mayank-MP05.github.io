# Deep Learning Face Recognition ML DL

This project focuses on both Machine learning and Deep learning part the core concept behind making of this project is to understand the ML/DL Workflow

### Wireframe bahind the Working :

1. Pick the Labelled image from the Directory
2. Detect the Face Area
3. Extract the Features like Eyes,Nose,Mouth,Jawline from face
4. Build Patterns based on that features (Deep Learning here)
5. ML model (Support Vector Machine) is used to classify faces based on Feature set
6. In This way above micro project works

Its accuracy is not very high as for the 7 classification set only few images are provided
for each class max to max 7 8 images are provided to keep it compute-light

Here are some final results of the Running Test ...

###### Some Prediction Worked Perfect
